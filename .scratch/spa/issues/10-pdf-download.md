# 10: Download the PDF

**What to build:** The user downloads the CV as a PDF from the CV page. Unsaved edits are saved first, and the user
is told what is missing instead of being blocked.

**Blocked by:** 07

**Status:** ready-for-agent

**Implements:** `.scratch/frontend-first/issues/10-pdf-download.md`

**Spec:** [../spec.md](../spec.md)

- [ ] Download button in the CV header, available only when the CV has a draft
- [ ] With unsaved edits the button reads "Save & download" and saves first; a failed save (validation, version conflict) stops the download and shows the error
- [ ] The file is fetched as a blob and handed to the browser with the filename from the response header (fallback `cv.pdf`); works in mobile Safari and Chrome
- [ ] While the file is prepared the button shows a pending state; errors are shown next to the button with a way to retry
- [ ] Open questions or missing required blocks do not block the download; a note lists what will be empty
- [ ] Mock mode returns a static A4 PDF fixture and `409 INVALID_STATE` for a CV without a draft
- [ ] Tests: dirty form saves before downloading; failed save stops the download; note about missing blocks
- [ ] The look follows `frontend/docs/design.md`; screenshots at 390 px and 1280 px in mock mode are checked against the prototype and mentioned in the report
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm build`, the format check and the tests pass

**Architecture:** Structure follows `frontend/docs/architecture.md`: the button lives in `cv-editor/components/pdf/`, `useDownloadPdf` in `cv-editor/api/`.
